# Pet-Project

The first task is to apply a machine learning algorithms for creating Recommendation System that will predict what banking products offer to their customers. 

The second task is to arrange the necessary objects on the map and show the principle of operation for detecting objects. For that purpose is used a parsing data from Google Maps about restaurants and shops in the center of Riga. Then, dataset of transactions is created and checked for anomalies. The algorithm has to decide whether the customer lives in the declared place.

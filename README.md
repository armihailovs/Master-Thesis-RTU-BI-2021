# Pet-Project

The task is to apply a machine learning algorithms for creating Recommendation System that will predict what banking products offer to their customers. Thus, this approach will encourage users to use Devices for daily payments. The sub-task is to build a dataset that will be used as background information for the approach. Then, perform an explanatory data analysis for building a multi-class classification system that will predict the customers preferences. The following sub-tasks are to improve the model by data quality checks, generating new features, tuning the parameters and removing irrelevant information. 

The second task is to arrange the necessary objects on the map and show the principle of operation for detecting objects. For that purpose is used a parsing data from Google Maps about restaurants and shops in the center of Riga.
